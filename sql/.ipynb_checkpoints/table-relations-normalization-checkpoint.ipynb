    "We previously learned that each table has one or more columns shaded in yellow, which indicates they are the **primary key**. A primary key is a unique identifier for each row - you cannot have two rows in a table with the same value for the primary key column(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "When two tables have a relation, there will be a column in one table that is a primary key in another table. For example, in the `invoice_line` table, the `invoice_id` column is the primary key from the `invoice` table. This is known as a **foreign key**. By defining a foreign key, our database engine will prevent us from adding rows where the foreign key value doesn't exist in the other table, which helps to prevent errors in our data (note that by default SQLite doesn't force foreign key constraints, however we have [changed the default](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44857286/4691920) for this mission).\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, a primary key is specified as part of a create statement. Once the primary key is defined, the database engine will prevent any new rows from being added to the database if they have the same primary key as any existing rows. If we wanted to re-create the table from the previous exercise with a primary key, we would use this syntax:\n",

In database normalization theory, there are several different phases of normalization, known as [normal forms](http://www.bkent.net/Doc/simple5.htm). Knowing each normal form is not as important as understanding the goals of normalization, and designing your databases to avoid data duplication and integrity issues. We'll learn more about database normalization in the next mission, however for now let's look at how we can design our wishlist tables with normalization in mind:\n",

The `wishlist_track` table has two columns that are both yellow to indicate that they're primary keys, since neither column will uniquely identify each row by itself. When two or more columns combine to form a primary key it is called a **compound primary key**. To create a compound primary key, you use the `PRIMARY KEY` clause:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Both columns in the `wishlist_track` table also have lines to indicate that they are foreign keys. To create a table with multiple foreign keys, you simply use multiple `FOREIGN KEY` clauses.\n",

One approach might be just to `DELETE` the row from `wishlist_track`. The downside of this approach is that we don't retain any historical data on which tracks were added to wishlists which reduces our ability to analyze this in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better approach would be to add a column that has a boolean value to show whether the row is active or not, and just change that value if the user wants to delete a track. We can do a similar thing with the wishlists themselves, so users can delete (or technically, deactivate) wishlists they no longer want to use.\n",

    "`UPDATE [table_name]\n",
    "SET [column_name] = [expression]\n",
    "WHERE [expression]`\n",

    "\n",
    "`UPDATE customer\n",
    "SET phone = \"+55 (12) 3921-4464\"\n",
    "WHERE customer_id = 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a **subquery that returns a single value**:\n",

    "`UPDATE track\n",
    "SET unit_price = ( \n",
    "SELECT AVG(unit_price) \n",
    "FROM track )`\n",

    "\n",
    "`UPDATE track\n",
    "SET unit_price = unit_price * 1.1`\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we can **set more than one column at once**:\n",
    "\n",
    "`UPDATE wishlist_track\n",
    "SET active = 1, purchased = 0;`\n",
    "\n",
