    "# Querying SQLite from Python\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is a database that doesn't require a standalone server; it stores the entire database as a file on disk. This makes it ideal for working with larger datasets that can fit on disk but not in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python loads the entire data set we're working with into memory, making SQLite a compelling alternative for working with data sets larger than 8 gigabytes (which is roughly the amount of memory modern computers contain). The fact that we can contain an entire database in a single file makes them easy to share; some data sets are available online as SQLite database files (using the extension `.db`).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can interact with a SQLite database in two main ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Through the [sqlite3 Python module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)\n",
    "- Through the [SQLite shell](https://sqlite.org/cli.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we'll learn how to use the sqlite3 module to interact with the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full table has many more columns than the ones we've displayed above (21 to be specific). You can learn about all of them in [FiveThirtyEight's GitHub repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the descriptions for the columns in the preview:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Rank`: The major's rank by median earnings\n",
    "- `Major_code`: The major's code or ID\n",
    "- `Major`: The name of the major\n",
    "- `Major_category`: The broader category the major belongs to\n",
    "- `Total`: The total number of people who studied the major\n",
    "- `Sample_size`: The sample size (unweighted) of graduates with full time jobs\n",
    "- `Men`: The number of male graduates\n",
    "- `Women`: The number of female graduates\n",
    "- `ShareWomen`: Women as a proportion of the total number of graduates (a number ranging from `0` to `1`)\n",
    "- `Employed`: The number of employed graduates\n",
    "\n",
    "We've loaded a subset of the data into a table named `recent_grads` in a database. The subset contains the 2010-2012 data for recent college grads only. The database file we'll be working with is called `jobs.db`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Commecting to the Database\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 2.5 and up come with the sqlite module, which means we don't need to install any separate libraries to get started. Specifically, we'll work with the sqlite3 Python module, which was developed to work with [SQLite version 3](https://www.sqlite.org/version3.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can import it into our environment using this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    `import sqlite3`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we import the module, we connect to the database we want to query using the `[connect]`(https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.connect)function. This function requires a single parameter, which is the database we want to connect to. Because the database we're working with exists as a file on disk, we need to pass in the file name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `connect()` function returns a [Connection instance](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection), which maintains the connection to the database we want to work with. When we're connected to a database, SQLite locks the database file and prevents any other processes from connecting to the database simultaneously. The SQLite team made this design decision to keep the database lightweight, and avoid the complexity that arises when multiple processes interact with the same database."

    "A *[tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences)* is a core data structure that Python uses to represent a sequence of values, similar to a *list*.

    "## Execute as a Shortcut for Running a Query\n",

    "So far, we've run queries by creating a Cursor instance, and then calling the `execute` method on the instance. The SQLite library actually allows us to skip creating a Cursor altogether by using the `[execute` method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection.execute) within the Connection object itself. SQLite will create a Cursor instance for us under the hood and run our query against the database, allowing us to skip a step. Here's what the code looks like:\n",

To return a single result (as a *tuple*), we use the [Cursor method `fetchone()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor.fetchone). To return `n` results, we use the [Cursor method `fetchmany()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor.fetchmany).\n",

    "Each Cursor instance contains an internal counter that updates every time we retrieve results. When we call the `fetchone()` method, the Cursor instance will return a single result, and then increment its internal counter by 1. This means that if we call `fetchone()` again, the Cursor instance will actually return the second tuple in the results set (and increment by 1 again).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `fetchmany()` method takes in an integer (`n`) and returns the corresponding results, starting from the current position. It then increments the Cursor instance's counter by `n`. In the following code, we return the first two results using the `fetchone()` method, then the next five results using the `fetchmany()` method.\n",
